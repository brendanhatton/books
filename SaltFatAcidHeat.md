# Chapter 1 - Salt
The most important flavour enhancer. Most people need to use more than they do. Learn to adjust the amount by tasting. When properly seasoned, the dish will 'zing'.
The timing of application of salt makes a difference - ie, during cooking has more of an impact than at the table.

_Salt has a greater impact on flavour than any other ingredient_

Different types of salt have different properties, mostly relating to the shape and texture of the crystals.
Table salt is small, dense granules. Sumina hates iodised salt, apparently it tastes metallic - she highly recommends sticking to kosher or sea salt instead.
Kosher salt is cheap and forgiving and a good goto (Brendan's note: I haven't seen this in the shops - maybe its not an Australian thing?)
Sea salt is evaporated slowly, taking up to 5 years - hence more expensive. 

Taste buds can detect 5 things - saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness and umami. 
Our nose is where everything else is detected - eg earthy, fruity, etc.
Flavour is at the intersection of taste and aroma, as well as texture, temperature etc.

Salt affects the taste, but also unlocks the aroma of other elements of the food.
Suggested making chicken stock and continuously tasting as you add salt, until you get the 'zing' - thats what "salting to taste" means, and is the goal.
Salt also counteracts bitterness, much more effectively than sugar.

"In general, the absense of salt in food is deeply regrettable, its overt presence is equally unwelcome: food shouldn't be _salty_, it should be _salted_.

Osmosis sees water move torwards salt.
Diffusion sees salt move to evenly distribute itself.
Together, this means sprinkling salt on the surface of meat will both draw water out, and with time, the salt will penetrate within the meat. 

Time + salt is the key for meat. Aim to salt the day before.
1. Diffusion is slow, can take hours
2. Salt dissolves some proteins, allowing them to absord and retain water as they cook - making for a more tender result.
eg, a turkey left in salty brine overnight will be much more moist and tender than otherwise.

Seafood is too delicate to withstand long salting, usually only 15 minutes or less.

Add salt to eggs will see them cook faster and hold on to more water, for a better result

Use salt when blanching vegetables - it should taste like seawater. Salt helps overcome the pectin in vegetables, which softens them.
By salting the cooking water for vegetables, more nutrients stay in the food. By making the water equal (or more) mineral rich than the vegetables, the osmosis impact will be lessened or reversed.

Rough ratio guide:
Meat - 1% by weight
Vegetable / pasta water - 2%

Salt can also come in via other foods - eg:
* anchovies / sardines
* capers
* pickles
* miso paste
* soy sauce
* prociutto, pancetta etc
* olives
* salted butter

If you oversalt, dilution is the only sure fix - ie, increase the amount of everything else to balance it out. 
Can try balancing with acid (sometimes works)

# Chapter 2 - Fat
As a foundational ingredient, the flavour of the fat we choose to cook with alters our perception of the entire dish.
Fat is one of the four basic elements of all food, along with water, protein and carbohydrate.
Fat plays three distinct roles:
* as a main ingredient (such as fat in a burger patty)
* as a cooking medium (such as oil)
* as seasoning (such as sour cream / mayonnaise)

Common sources of fat:
* butter
* oils
* animal fat
* cured meats (bacon, prosciutto etc)
* nuts and coconuts
* cream, sour cream
* cocoa butter and chocolate
* cheese
* yoghurt
* eggs
* oily fish
* avocado

Fat carries flavour, allowing us to notice other compounds that might be hidden. Fats coat the tongue and stick the flavour compounds to it for longer, allowing us to feel them more.
Becase of their high temperature tolerance, they can superheat the surface of food, leading to browning which creates huge amounts of flavours (ie the Maillard reaction).

Olive oil does not last beyond ~12-14 months from pressing. If it smells like crayons, candle wax, or oil from the top of peanut butter it is probably rancid. Check the dates!

Butter is a combination of fat, water, milk protein and whey solids.
Gently heat unsalted butter until the whey solids go brown and you have brown butter, common in French cooking.
Melt unsalted butter over low heat and the whey proteins will float, the fat and milk proteins will sink and the water will evaporate. Skim off the whey, strain the rest through a cheesecloth and you have clarified butter, which can get much hotter without burning.

Seed and nut oils generally don't have much flavour and have high smoke points.

Animal fat tastes more like the animal than the lean meat does (so chicken fat is more chickeny than chicken breast).
Beef fat when solid is suet. When liquid is tallow.
Pork fat when solid is pork fat. When liquid is lard.

Fat can help food become crispy, one of the most satisfying textures. Fat acts as the medium between the food and the pan, at a microscopic level, increasing the contact of the food to the pan, allowing the surface temperature to climb high enough to boil the water in the cells. For this the pan and fat needs to be hot. Cook only a little at a time.

Use enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan when sauteing, halfway up the food when shallow frying.

As oil is heated it begins breaking down, so (aside from butter which will burn) pre heat the pan, then add oil. You know the temperature is right if the food gently sizzles when you put it in. 

Rendering fat means cooking over low heat with a little water until the water has evaporated and the fat is liquified. 

Crispy bacon is the result of cooking it slowly enough that the fat renders at the same rate the bacon browns. Too high temperature will see the outside burn while still flabby.

Rendering the fat strip on steaks by putting it fat side down at either the start or end of cooking and allowing the fat to render

**The goal with all cooking is to achieve the desired result on the outside and inside of an ingredient at the same time**

An emulsion is when two liquids that don't usually mix together give up and combine - like a temporary peace treaty between fat and water. But if its only those two, it will soon break. An emulsifier helps make the combination stable. Mustard (vinaigrette) and egg yolk (mayonnaise) are common emulsifiers.

Butter (aka coagulated sunlight) - "With enough butter, anything is good".

Baked goods
Gluten makes food chewy. In bread this is a good thing, hence the long time and kneading involved. In pastry, not good, so they use low protein flour and avoid kneading. Fat will also coat the gluten strands and prevent the network growing (hence the term 'shortening').
Four main variables control the texture of a baked good:
* fat
* water
* yeast
* amount of working dough / yeast has had

Short doughs are crumbly (eg shortbread cookies) and use warm or melted butter
Flaky doughs flake (eg pie pastry) and use cold butter. The cold butter and trapped air push the pastry apart as it cooks, creating the flakes.

Tender cakes use oil, not butter!
Gently beating butter together with sugar (4-7 minutes) will trap millions of air bubbles, making for super light an airy cake (don't accidentally squash the air out when later combining with other ingredients)
