# Chapter 1 - Salt
The most important flavour enhancer. Most people need to use more than they do. Learn to adjust the amount by tasting. When properly seasoned, the dish will 'zing'.
The timing of application of salt makes a difference - ie, during cooking has more of an impact than at the table.

_Salt has a greater impact on flavour than any other ingredient_

Different types of salt have different properties, mostly relating to the shape and texture of the crystals.
Table salt is small, dense granules. Sumina hates iodised salt, apparently it tastes metallic - she highly recommends sticking to kosher or sea salt instead.
Kosher salt is cheap and forgiving and a good goto (Brendan's note: I haven't seen this in the shops - maybe its not an Australian thing?)
Sea salt is evaporated slowly, taking up to 5 years - hence more expensive. 

Taste buds can detect 5 things - saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness and umami. 
Our nose is where everything else is detected - eg earthy, fruity, etc.
Flavour is at the intersection of taste and aroma, as well as texture, temperature etc.

Salt affects the taste, but also unlocks the aroma of other elements of the food.
Suggested making chicken stock and continuously tasting as you add salt, until you get the 'zing' - thats what "salting to taste" means, and is the goal.
Salt also counteracts bitterness, much more effectively than sugar.

"In general, the absense of salt in food is deeply regrettable, its overt presence is equally unwelcome: food shouldn't be _salty_, it should be _salted_.

Osmosis sees water move torwards salt.
Diffusion sees salt move to evenly distribute itself.
Together, this means sprinkling salt on the surface of meat will both draw water out, and with time, the salt will penetrate within the meat. 

Time + salt is the key for meat. Aim to salt the day before.
1. Diffusion is slow, can take hours
2. Salt dissolves some proteins, allowing them to absord and retain water as they cook - making for a more tender result.
eg, a turkey left in salty brine overnight will be much more moist and tender than otherwise.

Seafood is too delicate to withstand long salting, usually only 15 minutes or less.

Add salt to eggs will see them cook faster and hold on to more water, for a better result

Use salt when blanching vegetables - it should taste like seawater. Salt helps overcome the pectin in vegetables, which softens them.
By salting the cooking water for vegetables, more nutrients stay in the food. By making the water equal (or more) mineral rich than the vegetables, the osmosis impact will be lessened or reversed.

Rough ratio guide:
Meat - 1% by weight
Vegetable / pasta water - 2%

Salt can also come in via other foods - eg:
* anchovies / sardines
* capers
* pickles
* miso paste
* soy sauce
* prociutto, pancetta etc
* olives
* salted butter

If you oversalt, dilution is the only sure fix - ie, increase the amount of everything else to balance it out. 
Can try balancing with acid (sometimes works)
